Graphical Password Authentication System

• Users will be required to provide a username and password to register for the first time. The password has to be uploaded from 9 pre-defined images. The sequence 
  in which it is uploaded has to be remembered.
• To login, the user again needs to provide the username and the same password in the same sequence. The account will be loocked after 4 incorrect trials.
• This graphical password system aims to enhance security and provide a visually engaging authentication experience.

This project uses tkinter to create the Graphical Interface and MySql to create a database to store the usernames and passwords. Pyhton is used as the programming language.

There are three pyhton files register.py, login.py and welcome.py. 
The images used are provided in the Images folder.
(## I DID MENTION IN THE PROPOSAL THAT I WOULD BE ADDING 15 IMAGES, BUT IT DID NOT FIT ON SCREEN. INSTEAD I MADE IT USING 10 IMAGES. IT IS THE SAME CONCEPT. 15 IMAGES CAN BE ADDED BY RESIZING THE IMAGES; BUT THEN EACH IMAGE WILL BECOME TOO SMALL.##)
